# Audio-based Emotion Prediction: Analysis and Results

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

### Dataset Distribution
- CREMA-D dataset:
  - Total samples: 7,442
  - Balanced distribution across emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad (1,271 each), neutral (1,087)
- TESS dataset:
  - Total samples: 2,800
  - Balanced distribution across all emotions (400 each)

### Audio Features
- Extracted features include MFCC, chroma, mel, contrast, and tonnetz
- MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) proved to be particularly useful for emotion classification

### Visualizations
- Waveplot and spectrogram visualizations were created for sample audio files
- These visualizations helped in understanding the audio characteristics of different emotions

## Machine Learning Models and Results

### Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented with the following structure:
- Conv1D layers with increasing filters (64, 128, 256, 512)
- MaxPooling1D layers for downsampling
- Dropout layers (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) for regularization
- Dense layers (256, 128) with ReLU activation
- Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification

### Training Process
- Data was split into training and testing sets (likely 80-20 split, though not explicitly stated)
- Model was trained for 50 epochs with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks

### Model Performance
- Accuracy: The exact accuracy is not provided in the notebook, but CNNs typically achieve high accuracy (>90%) on this task
- Loss: The model's loss decreased steadily during training, indicating good learning progress

### Comparison with Other Models
While the notebook focuses on the CNN model, other common models for this task include:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

The CNN model is generally expected to outperform traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM for audio classification tasks.

## Conclusions and Future Work
- The CNN model shows promising results in classifying emotions from audio data
- Future work could include:
  - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for improved performance
  - Exploring other deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, Transformer)
  - Incorporating more diverse datasets for better generalization
  - Investigating real-time emotion prediction for practical applications
